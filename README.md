# Box't Out
An open source food delivery product and service that will be developed on the FilledStacks YouTube channel. The repo will contain all the software required to run the open source Box't Out food delivery product. This is not a "product for a tutorial", this will be an actual product. It just so happens that I'll be making a tutorial and video for every part of it that is developed as well as make all the code availbale through this repository. The text from this readme will later be moved into it's own file but for now since there's no code or code we can use it to declare the purpose of the project and how it'll be built.
